							<h2>I Sliced My SIEM: Finally Getting Value out of Your SIEM!</h2>
						</a>
						<p>SIEM history is linked to the evolution of the security industry. It has been designed initially to
							manage NIDS noise and then evolved to a correlation platform where outcomes of penetration test reports
							can be encoded. A couple of years ago, PCI-DSS and other regulations required "log analysis" to check the
							compliance box and companies matured in security incident response and forensics. SIEM was the natural
							answer for those needs. That lead many companies to invest (heavily) into SIEM technologies.</p>
						<p>Nowadays when you talk to executives about SIEM the most common word used is "disappointment". It
							represents a lot of money and benefit is very low. This talk is about sharing experienced processes that
							can help any organization to get value out of the SIEM. It is NOT about new "shiny tools" or "easy tricks"
							that will increase the bill, but test proofed manageable processes that will help you to get the most out
							of your SIEM.</p>

							<h2>Automated, Generic System Call Hooking, and Interpretation</h2>
						</a>
						<p>When doing malware analysis, monitoring application behavior plays an essential role. To do that, one of
							our most used mechanisms is system call monitoring. In contrast to approaches that e.g. put breakpoints
							into mapped libraries, we employ a VM monitor approach that catches the SYSCALL instruction itself. When
							interrupting processes on such instructions, what syscall did they actually attempt to use and what do the
							parameters mean, as it’s all encoded in CPU registers or the stack? In order to solve that problem in the
							most elegant way for our users, we needed a library of signatures of all syscalls along with the data
							structure types and formats they use. We automated the process of harvesting system calls and data
							structure definitions from multiple public open-source sources and preprocessing them to produce a single
							data source in machine-readable form. We present the results that we keep OSS to share with the community,
							and demonstrate how this improves the analyst workflow.</p>

						<p>In this workshop, we are going to explore how AppArmor can be used to sandbox processes on Linux in

							theoretical introduction after which we will cover the following practical tasks and topics:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Checking AppArmor status and related kernel parameters</li>
							<li>Loading AppArmor and policies at boot time</li>
							<li>Checking the security context of running processes</li>
							<li>Creating AppArmor profiles using automated tools (aa-autodep, aa-genprof, aa-logprof, etc.)</li>
							<li>Basics of the AppArmor profile language</li>
							<li>Understanding and using common profile abstractions (/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions)</li>
							<li>Inspecting and interpreting AppArmor logs (for debugging and monitoring)</li>
							<li>Basic profile management tasks and utilities (aa-enforce, aa-complain, aa-disable, apparmor_parser,
								etc.)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>After completing these smaller exercises, we are going to write a profile for a Python web application
							that uses a vulnerable third-party CLI (ImageMagick/convert) tool. We will see how we can use AppArmor to
							immunize our web application to certain vulnerabilities in third-party components and inside the web
							service itself.</p>
						<p>We are going to learn how the AppArmor userspace API (aa_change_profile and aa_change_hat) can be used to
